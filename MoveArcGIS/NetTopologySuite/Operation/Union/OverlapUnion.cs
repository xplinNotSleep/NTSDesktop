    /// Unions MultiPolygons efficiently by
    /// using full topological union only for polygons which may overlap,
    /// and combining with the remaining polygons.
    /// Polygons which may overlap are those which intersect the common extent of the inputs.
    /// Polygons wholly outside this extent must be disjoint to the computed union.
    /// They can thus be simply combined with the union result,
    /// which is much more performant.
    /// (There is one caveat to this, which is discussed below).
    /// <para/>
    /// This situation is likely to occur during cascaded polygon union,
    /// since the partitioning of polygons is done heuristically
    /// and thus may group disjoint polygons which can lie far apart.
    /// It may also occur in real world data which contains many disjoint polygons
    /// (e.g. polygons representing parcels on different street blocks).
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    /// The overlap region is determined as the common envelope of intersection.
    /// The input polygons are partitioned into two sets:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item><term>Overlapping</term><description>Polygons which intersect the overlap region, and thus potentially overlap each other</description></item>
    /// <item><term>Disjoint</term><description>Polygons which are disjoint from (lie wholly outside) the overlap region</description></item>
    /// </list>
    /// The Overlapping set is fully unioned, and then combined with the Disjoint set.
    /// Performing a simple combine works because
    /// the disjoint polygons do not interact with each
    /// other(since the inputs are valid MultiPolygons).
    /// They also do not interact with the Overlapping polygons,
    /// since they are outside their envelope.
    /// <h2>Discussion</h2>
    /// In general the Overlapping set of polygons will
    /// extend beyond the overlap envelope.  This means that the union result
    /// will extend beyond the overlap region.
    /// There is a small chance that the topological
    /// union of the overlap region will shift the result linework enough
    /// that the result geometry intersects one of the Disjoint geometries.
    /// This situation is detected and if it occurs
    /// is remedied by falling back to performing a full union of the original inputs.
    /// Detection is done by a fairly efficient comparison of edge segments which
    /// extend beyond the overlap region.  If any segments have changed
    /// then there is a risk of introduced intersections, and full union is performed.
    /// <para/>
    /// This situation has not been observed in JTS using floating precision,
    /// but it could happen due to snapping.  It has been observed
    /// in other APIs(e.g.GEOS) due to more aggressive snapping.
    /// It is more likely to happen if a Snap - Rounding overlay is used.
